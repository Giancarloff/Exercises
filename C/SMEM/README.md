# Simple Memory Management (SMeM)

#### I asked for ChatGPT to give me an exercise to do in C and one of the suggestions was implementing a custom memory allocator. The file `smem.h` and `smem.c` resulted from this. Specifically, the exercise asked for:
##### `1. malloc`
##### `2. free`
##### `3. realloc`
#### Which became respectively:
##### `1. smem_malloc`
##### `2. smem_free`
##### `3. smem_realloc` (not implemented)
#### ChatGPT suggested I used `mmap` to get things started. While that facilitated more than I expected, it still allowed me to practice some C after years of not doing anything in the language. I think it was decent enough for a "coming back" exercise. Right now I have no plans of coming back to this.
